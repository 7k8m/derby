1. A large number of the scripts expect builds and UpdateInfo to exist in ${DERBYDIR}/testing/. 
   A better location is ${DERBYDIR}/. 
   Fix the relevant scripts to use ${DERBYDIR}/builds and ${DERBYDIR}/UpdateInfo.
   (Currently handled using symlinks....)

2. Merge production of Full and Limited reports. No need to have Limited at all?

3. "Exception handling" in the scripts should be better....

4. Convert the scripts to Ant! (and Java...)

5. Use some standardized mechanism to format the report pages: E.g. XSLT, XPATH...

6. Keep revision, build and test data in a (Derby) database.
