<blockquote>


<p>
The most up to date information about Derby releases can be found on the
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html">Derby download page</a>.
</p>


<p>
Apache Derby is a pure Java relational database engine using standard SQL and
JDBC as its APIs. More information about Derby can be found on the
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache web site</a>.
Derby functionality includes:
</p>


<ul>

<li>Embedded engine with JDBC drivers</li>

<li>Network Server</li>

<li>Network client JDBC drivers</li>

<li>Command line tools: ij (SQL scripting), dblook (schema dump) and sysinfo (system info)</li>

</ul>


<p>
Java and JDBC versions supported:
<ul>
  
<li>Java SE 1.4 and higher with
    JDBC 2.1, 3.0, 4.0 and 4.1</li>
  
<li>Java ME CDC/Foundation Profile 1.1 with
    JSR-169 JDBC Optional Package for CDC/Foundation Profile.</li>

</ul>

</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="New Features"></a>New Features</h2>
<blockquote>


<p>
This is a feature release. The following new features were added:
</p>


<ul>


<li>
<b>JDBC 4.1</b> - Derby's JDBC drivers support the new Java 7 methods on <i>java.sql</i> and <i>javax.sql</i> interfaces.</li>
	

<li>
<b>Automatic calculation of index stats</b> - Derby recalculates optimizer statistics on tables whose statistics have grown stale.</li>
	

<li>
<b>Improved interrupt handling </b> - Thread interrupts no longer crash the Derby engine.</li>
	

<li>
<b>MAX optimization</b> - On indexed tables, MAX queries run faster in more cases.</li>


</ul>

<p>Compared with the previous release (10.7.1.1), Derby release 10.8.0.0 introduces the following new features and incompatibilities. These merit your special attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#Note for DERBY-4965">
<p>Note for DERBY-4965: 
JDBC-level conversion from BOOLEAN to CHAR changed
</p>

<a href="#Note for DERBY-4856">
<p>Note for DERBY-4856: 
On experiencing a system crash or session error, Derby will print as much diagnostic information as possible to the Derby error log, including stack traces of all threads.i.e. Users will find thread dump information with error severity higher than session error in the Derby error log. It is also possible to get thread dump and diagnostic information for errors with lower severity by adjusting a property.
</p>
</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#Note for DERBY-4614">
<p>Note for DERBY-4614: 
The precision and scale of Timestamps, reported by JDBC metadata, has changed.

</li>
<li>
<a href="#Note for DERBY-2905">
<p>Note for DERBY-2905: 
After a shutdown of the embedded driver, the AutoloadedDriver is unregistered from the DriverManager. Users who wish to keep the AutoloadedDriver can set the deregister attribute on the connection url to false. The default behavior is to unregister AutoloadedDriver from DriverManager (deregister=true).

<a name="Note for DERBY-4965"></a>Note for DERBY-4965</h3>
<blockquote>

<!-- 
  SUMMARIZE THE ISSUE. This is a one line summary of the issue.

  For instance:

  Applications may no longer open two InputStreams on the same ResultSet column.
-->


<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
JDBC-level conversion from BOOLEAN to CHAR changed
</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS.

  For instance:

  In the previous release, applications were able to open two
  InputStreams on the same column. Depending on how these streams
  interacted, the value siphoned out of the column was erratic. Now
  Derby raises a SQLException when the application attempts to create
  the second InputStream.
-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
In previous releases of Derby, when
using <tt>PreparedStatement.setObject()</tt>
or <tt>PreparedStatement.setBoolean()</tt> to initialize a character
type parameter (CHAR, VARCHAR, etc.) with a boolean value, the
parameter would be set to the value "1" or "0" for <tt>true</tt>
or <tt>false</tt>, respectively.
</p>

<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS RELEASE, IF ANY.

  For instance:

  Applications which open two InputStreams on the ResultSet column now
  fail.
-->


<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>
In this release, <tt>PreparedStatement.setObject()</tt>
and <tt>PreparedStatement.setBoolean()</tt> will convert the boolean
values <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt> to the strings "true" and
"false", respectively, if the type of the parameter is one of the
character types.
</p>

<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
The previous behavior caused failures in a JDBC compliance test after
Derby's meta-data started reporting that the BOOLEAN data type was
supported in version 10.7.1.1.
</p>


<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE HOW TO REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR OR
  OTHERWISE AVOID THE INCOMPATIBILITIES INTRODUCED BY THIS CHANGE.

  For instance:

  Users must recode applications which open multiple streams on the same column.
-->


<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
If the application expects the parameter to be set to "1" or "0"
instead of "true" or "false", it must be recoded to explicitly set the
parameter to an integer value.
</p>


<p>
For example, if an application uses setBoolean() to set a character
type parameter, it could be changed from
</p>


<blockquote>

<pre>
ps.setBoolean(col, b);
</pre>

</blockquote>


<p>
to
</p>


<blockquote>

<pre>
ps.setInt(col, b ? 1 : 0);
</pre>

</blockquote>


<p>
in order to preserve the old behavior.
</p>

-->


<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
On experiencing a system crash or session error, Derby will print as much diagnostic information as possible to the Derby error log, including stack traces of all threads.i.e. Users will find thread dump information with error severity higher than session error in the Derby error log. It is also possible to get thread dump and diagnostic information for errors with lower severity by adjusting a property.
</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS.

  For instance:

  In the previous release, applications were able to open two
  InputStreams on the same column. Depending on how these streams
  interacted, the value siphoned out of the column was erratic. Now
  Derby raises a SQLException when the application attempts to create
  the second InputStream.
-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
If errors have error severity level greater or equal than value derby.stream.error.extendedDiagSeverityLevel is set, thread dump information and extened diagnostic information will be printed by Derby. Users can find thread dump information in the Derby error log. For IBM JVM users, a javacore file will be created.

</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
The intention of the change to get more detail information related to the status of Derby when important errors happen, "important" by default meaning errors with session severity and higher. This will help users, DBAs and support personnel to dertermine the exact cause of the error condition or system crash.
</p>


<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE HOW TO REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR OR
  OTHERWISE AVOID THE INCOMPATIBILITIES INTRODUCED BY THIS CHANGE.

  For instance:

  Users must recode applications which open multiple streams on the same column.
-->


<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
Users do not need to change anything for this change. If more thread dump information is required for errors that have severity level less than session error, the property derby.stream.error.extendedDiagSeverityLevel can be set. Please refer to <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.7/devguide/cdevsetprop16827.html">Derby system property</a> For example, if there is a deadlock issue and users would like to see thread dump information while the deadlock is happening, users can then set derby.stream.error.extendedDiagSeverityLevel=30000. The diagnostics and the thread dump information is found in the Derby error log. derby.stream.error.extendedDiagSeverityLevel=30000 means that extra diagnostics and thread dump will be activated for errors with severity equal to or higher than transaction severity (30000). Please consult the Derby documentation for explanation of error severity and for other possible settings of extenedDiagSeverityLevel.

<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
The precision and scale of Timestamps, reported by JDBC metadata, has changed.

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
Previously, JDBC metadata calls reported that Derby Timestamps had
precision 26 and scale 6. Now the precision of Timestamps is 29 and
the scale is 9. The following metadata
have been corrected:
</p>


<ul>

<li>
<b>DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo()</b> - The PRECISION and MINIMUM_SCALE fields were wrong.</li>

<li>
<b>DatabaseMetaData.getColumns()</b> - The COLUMN_SIZE and DECIMAL_DIGITS fields were wrong.</li>

<li>
<b>DatabaseMetaData.getProcedureColumns()</b> - The PRECISION and SCALE fields were wrong.</li>

<li>
<b>DatabaseMetaData.getFunctionColumns()</b> - The PRECISION and SCALE fields were wrong.</li>

<li>
<b>ResultSetMetaData</b> - Wrong results came back from the getColumnDisplaySize(), getPrecision(), and getScale() methods.</li>

<li>
<b>ParameterMetaData</b> - Wrong results came back from the getPrecision() and getScale() methods.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<!--

<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
The metadata was changed to reflect the actual precision and scale of
Derby Timestamps, which are simply instances of <i>java.sql.Timestamp</i>.

<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
Applications, which consulted JDBC metadata in order to determine the
length of Timestamps, should be tested (and if necessary recoded) to
verify that they correctly handle the longer lengths.

<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
After a shutdown of the embedded driver, the AutoloadedDriver is unregistered from the DriverManager. Users who wish to keep the AutoloadedDriver can set the deregister attribute on the connection url to false. The default behavior is to unregister AutoloadedDriver from DriverManager (deregister=true).

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
Application that have seen problems due to the AutoloadedDriver remaining registered should no longer see the associated leaks. Applications that had worked around the issue by calling DriverManager.deregister(driver) should remove the work around code.

<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
After a shutdown of the embedded driver, the AutoloadDriver was not unregistered from the DriverManager preventing garage collection of the Derby classes. The change allows shutdown to completely remove Derby but provides an attribute to keep the AutoloadedDriver loaded if that is the desired behavior.

If users prefer the autoloading behavior after engine shutdown, they need to set the deregister=false attribute when shutting down Derby.

<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
Requirements for XML operators have changed

  In the previous release, applications were able to open two
  InputStreams on the same column. Depending on how these streams

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>


<p>
Applications that use any of the XML operators
(<tt>XMLPARSE</tt>, <tt>XMLSERIALIZE</tt>, <tt>XMLQUERY</tt>
or <tt>XMLEXISTS</tt>) may fail with the following error message after
upgrading to Derby 10.8:
</p>


<pre>
ERROR XML00: Failed to locate 'XPath 3.0' API or implementation classes.  XML operations are not permitted unless these classes are in your classpath.
</pre>


<p>
This happens if the Java Runtime Environment doesn't have
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/">DOM Level 3
XPath</a> interfaces or an implementation of those interfaces on the
classpath.
</p>

<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>


<p>
Previous releases of Derby required a recent version of Apache
Xalan-Java in order to support the XML operators. Since not all
platforms include Apache Xalan-Java, and some platforms contain a
modified version with a different interface, these operators didn't
work out of the box on many platforms.
</p>


<p>
In this release, the XML operators access the platform's XML libraries
via the <tt>javax.xml</tt> and <tt>org.w3c.dom</tt> interfaces instead
of accessing the Xalan implementation classes directly. This change
makes the XML operators work out of the box on most Java SE 6 or later
platforms, but may break the functionality on older platforms that
don't contain all the required interfaces.

<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>


<p>
In environments affected by this change, the XML operators can be made
working again either by upgrading the JVM (IBM's versions 1.5.0 and
1.6.0 and Oracle's version 1.6.0 are known to work), or by installing
a recent version of Apache Xalan-Java.
</p>


<p>
Installation of Xalan-Java may require the Endorsed Standards Override
Mechanism to be used. This is described in the "XML data types and
operators" section of the Derby Developer's Guide.

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and MD5 signatures.  MD5 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>


<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Derby
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>


<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

</pre>


<p>To verify the MD5 signature on the files, you need to use a program
called <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code>, which is
included in many unix distributions.  It is also available as part of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU
Textutils</a>.  Windows users can get binary md5 programs from <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/">here</a>, or
<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a>.</p>


<p>We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.</p>
