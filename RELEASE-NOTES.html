<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
The in-memory back end will no longer create a database if the virtual database directory already exists.
</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS.

  For instance:

  In the previous release, applications were able to open two

  Derby raises a SQLException when the application attempts to create
  the second InputStream.
-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
If database 'memory:/tmp/a/myDB' already exists, an attempt to create 'memory:/tmp/a' results in:
<pre>
ERROR XJ041: Failed to create database 'memory:/tmp/a', see the next exception for details.

<!--

-->


<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>
If two (or more) in-memory databases are created, the application may fail to create the second database if the database paths are overlapping.
</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
The fix makes the in-memory and the on-disk back ends consistent on this matter, and the change also fixes a memory leak when trying to boot a large number of non-existing in-memory databases (see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4432">DERBY-4432</a>).
</p>


<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE HOW TO REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR OR
  OTHERWISE AVOID THE INCOMPATIBILITIES INTRODUCED BY THIS CHANGE.

  For instance:

  Users must recode applications which open multiple streams on the same column.
-->


<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
Adjust the paths of the in-memory databases if required. In some cases it may be sufficient to reorder the database creations, but this is not recommended as it would potentially have severe side-effects with the on-disk back end (a database nested within another database).
</p>

<p>
There is no way to revert to the old behavior.

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
In the previous releases, SQL statements that referenced columns that

conditions fail with the following SQLState and message:

<pre>
ERROR 42972: An ON clause associated with a JOIN operator is not valid.
</pre>


<p>
Now, the statements that used to fail with that message will instead
fail with the following SQLState and message:
</p>


<pre>
ERROR 42X04: Column 'T1.X' is either not in any table in the FROM list or appears within a join specification and is outside the scope of the join specification or appears in a HAVING clause and is not in the GROUP BY list. If this is a CREATE or ALTER TABLE  statement then 'T1.X' is not a column in the target table.

<!--

  For instance:

-->


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
This change was necessary because the code that decided which of the
two errors to raise, contained some logic that was not compatible with
the introduction of sub-queries in ON clauses. Additionally, the new
message makes it easier to see what is the problem with the statement,
as it mentions both why the ON clause is invalid and the name of the
column that is out of scope.

<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
CROSS is now a reserved keyword and cannot be used as an unquoted identifier.

-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>

In previous releases of Derby, CROSS was not a reserved keyword, so
applications could use CROSS as an identifier without quoting
it. Applications that use CROSS as an identifier (for instance to name
tables, views, columns, functions or procedures) and don't quote it,
will now see errors similar to this one:

</p>


<pre>
ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered "cross" at line 1, column 15.
</pre>

<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS RELEASE, IF ANY.

  For instance:

  Applications which open two InputStreams on the ResultSet column now

<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>

Applications that use CROSS as an unquoted identifier will experience
syntax errors.

</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>

CROSS was made a reserved keyword in order to support the CROSS JOIN
operator. Also, the SQL:2003 standard defines CROSS as a reserved
keyword, so applications that use it as an unquoted identifier are not
portable.

</p>


<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE HOW TO REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR OR
  OTHERWISE AVOID THE INCOMPATIBILITIES INTRODUCED BY THIS CHANGE.

  For instance:

  Users must recode applications which open multiple streams on the same column.
-->


<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>

SQL statements where CROSS is used as an unquoted identifier must be
rewritten so that CROSS is enclosed in double quotes.

</p>


<p>Examples:</p>


<p>
The statement <code>create table cross(x int)</code> must be rewritten
to <code>create table "CROSS"(x int)</code>. Similarly, the
statement <code>select * from cross</code> will have to be rewritten
to <code>select * from "CROSS"</code>.

  For instance:

  Applications may no longer open two InputStreams on the same ResultSet column.
-->


<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
After the change for DERBY-4312, if a user attempts to reuse a stream set on a <code> PreparedStatement </code> with <code> setAsciiStream()</code>, <code>setCharacterStream()</code>, or  <code> setBinaryStream() </code> after commit, the incorrect error XJ215 will no longer be thrown.

-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
Users attempting to reuse streams after commit will no longer see error XJ215, but rather  an SQLException with SQLState XN017: <code>
 Network protocol error: end of stream prematurely reached, parameter #4. Remaining data has been  padded with 0x0. </code>

</p>

<p>
As the error suggests attempting to reuse streams can lead to wrong data being inserted.  The incorrect row insert should be rolled back or deleted and the application changed to not attempt to reuse streams.

</p>


<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS RELEASE, IF ANY.

  For instance:

  Applications which open two InputStreams on the ResultSet column now
  fail.
-->


<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>
There are no incompatibilities with releases prior to 10.4.1.3.  The XJ215 message when any stream was used after commit was a regression introduced with DERBY-3557 which went in in 10.4.2.0.  The DERBY-4312 fix corrects the regression, but also makes exposure to DERBY-4315 as likely as it was for releases prior to 10.4.2.0.

</p>


<!--

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior

<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
DERBY-4312 prevented any use of streams after commit. This was incorrect and a regression and needed to be fixed.

Applications should not attempt to reuse streams.  If users get the XN017 error and bad insert,  they should rollback the transaction or delete the offending row.

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
DERBY-4230 fixed an issue where an extra column might appear in DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() for a view that uses a group by and an expression in the select list.  The problem occurred during create view with the old release.  After  updating your derby jars to a release that has the fix, if you still see the behavior, you will need to drop and recreate the view to get the fix.

<!-- 
  Applications may start getting insufficient select privilege errors for queries that used to work despite insufficient privileges.
-->


<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
Make sure that user has at least one column level select privilege or table level select privilege for queries that do not select a specific column from the tables involved in the SELECT statement. Additionally, subqueries will require that the user has necessary select privileges in order to execute it.
</p>


<!-- 
  In the previous release, because of Derby bug, users were able to do selects from table even when they didn't have select privilege available on it. For eg the query below in previous release would succeed even if the user didn't have any select privilege on anotheruser.table1
    select 1 from anotheruser.table1
  Also, in the previous release, following query executed fine even if the user had only update privilege available on anotheruser.table1
    update anotheruser.table1 set a = ( select max(a) + 2 from anotheruser.table1 ); 
  Now, Derby raises a SQLException for those missing select privileges.
-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
Previous release incorrectly allowed a query execution despite insufficient privileges.
</p>


<!-- 
  The previous behavior incorrectly allowed users to execute a query even when the necessary privileges were not granted to them.

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
Specifying a negative length will raise an <em>SQLException</em> with a different state;
<ul>
<li>Now: <tt>XJ071: Negative length argument '-2' passed in a BLOB or CLOB method.</tt>
</li>

<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>
Applications catching a specific exception based on <em>SQLState</em> may behave differently. The incompatibility can only be seen if the application calls <tt>Clob.truncate</tt> with a negative length using the embedded driver.
