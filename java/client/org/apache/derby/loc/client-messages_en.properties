# This file contains messages that specific to the Derby client.
#
# You can use the message ids (or add message ids)
# defined in org.apache.derby.sahred.common.reference.SQLState.java in 
# network client code.  
#
# BEFORE YOU ADD A MESSAGE HERE, make sure a similar message doesn't already
# exist in java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages_en.properties.  If it
# does, you can reuse the matching message id and share this message across
# client and engine.  
#
# You do NOT need to copy the message from the engine messages_en.properties 
# to here.  This is done at build time.  If the message id starts with "XJ" 
# there is nothing you need to do, the copy is done automatically.  
#
# For any message ids that DO NOT START with "XJ" YOU NEED TO DO A LITTLE WORK.  
# In java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/splitmessages.java, you need to add 
# the message id to clientMessageIds in the static method initClientMessageIds().  
# If you do not do this YOUR MESSAGE WILL NOT BE COPIED and a default message 
# will be used.
