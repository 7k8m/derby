Start testing delete using JDBC2.0 updateable resultset apis
---Negative Testl - request for scroll insensitive updatable resultset will give a read only scroll insensitive resultset
warnings on connection = SQL Warning: Scroll sensitive and scroll insensitive updatable ResultSets are not currently implemented.
requested TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, CONCUR_UPDATABLE but that is not supported
Make sure that we got TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE? true
Make sure that we got CONCUR_READ_ONLY? true
ownDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE)? false
othersDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE)? false
deletesAreDetected(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE)? false
JDBC 2.0 updatable resultset api will fail on this resultset because this is not an updatable resultset
Got expected exception 'deleteRow' not allowed because the ResultSet is not an updatable ResultSet. 
---Negative Test2 - request for scroll sensitive updatable resultset will give a read only scroll insensitive resultset
requested TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, CONCUR_UPDATABLE but that is not supported
Make sure that we got TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE? true
Make sure that we got CONCUR_READ_ONLY? true
JDBC 2.0 updatable resultset api will fail on this resultset because this is not an updatable resultset
Got expected exception 'deleteRow' not allowed because the ResultSet is not an updatable ResultSet. 
---Negative Test3 - request a read only resultset and attempt deleteRow on it
Make sure that we got CONCUR_READ_ONLY? true
Now attempting to send a deleteRow on a read only resultset.
Got expected exception 'deleteRow' not allowed because the ResultSet is not an updatable ResultSet. 
---Negative Test4 - request a read only resultset and send a sql with FOR UPDATE clause and attempt deleteRow on it
Make sure that we got CONCUR_READ_ONLY? true
Now attempting to send a deleteRow on a read only resultset with FOR UPDATE clause in the SELECT sql.
Got expected exception 'deleteRow' not allowed because the ResultSet is not an updatable ResultSet. 
---Negative Test5 - request updatable resultset for sql with no FOR UPDATE clause
Make sure that we got CONCUR_READ_ONLY? true
Expected warnings on resultset = java.sql.SQLWarning: ResultSet not updatable. Query does not qualify to generate an updatable ResultSet.
Now attempting to send a delete on a sql with no FOR UPDATE clause.
Got expected exception 'deleteRow' not allowed because the ResultSet is not an updatable ResultSet. 
---Negative Test6 - request updatable resultset for sql with FOR READ ONLY clause
Make sure that we got CONCUR_READ_ONLY? true
Expected warnings on resultset = java.sql.SQLWarning: ResultSet not updatable. Query does not qualify to generate an updatable ResultSet.
Now attempting to send a delete on a sql with FOR READ ONLY clause.
Got expected exception 'deleteRow' not allowed because the ResultSet is not an updatable ResultSet. 
---Negative Test7 - attempt to deleteRow on updatable resultset when the resultset is not positioned on a row
Make sure that we got CONCUR_UPDATABLE? true
Now attempt a deleteRow without first doing next on the resultset.
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
ResultSet is positioned after the last row. attempt to deleteRow at this point should fail!
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
---Negative Test8 - attempt deleteRow on updatable resultset after closing the resultset
Make sure that we got CONCUR_UPDATABLE? true
Got expected exception ResultSet not open, operation 'deleteRow' not permitted. Verify that autocommit is OFF.
---Negative Test9 - try updatable resultset on system table
expected exception FOR UPDATE is not permitted on this type of statement.
---Negative Test10 - try updatable resultset on a view
expected exception FOR UPDATE is not permitted on this type of statement.
---Negative Test11 - attempt to open updatable resultset when there is join in the select query should fail
expected exception FOR UPDATE is not permitted on this type of statement.
---Negative Test12 - With autocommit on, attempt to drop a table when there is an open updatable resultset on it
Opened an updatable resultset. Now trying to drop that table through another Statement
expected exception Operation 'DROP TABLE' cannot be performed on object 'T1' because there is an open ResultSet dependent on that object.
Since autocommit is on, the drop table exception resulted in a runtime rollback causing updatable resultset object to close
expected exception ResultSet not open, operation 'deleteRow' not permitted. Verify that autocommit is OFF.
---Negative Test13 - foreign key constraint failure will cause deleteRow to fail
expected exception DELETE on table 'TABLEWITHPRIMARYKEY' caused a violation of foreign key constraint 'FK' for key (1,1).  The statement has been rolled back.
Since autocommit is on, the constraint exception resulted in a runtime rollback causing updatable resultset object to close
expected exception ResultSet not open, operation 'next' not permitted. Verify that autocommit is OFF.
---Positive Test1 - request updatable resultset for forward only type resultset
requested TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, CONCUR_UPDATABLE
got TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY? true
got CONCUR_UPDATABLE? true
JDBC 2.0 updatable resultset apis on this ResultSet object will pass because this is an updatable resultset
column 1 on this row before deleteRow is 1
column 2 on this row before deleteRow is aa                  
Since after deleteRow(), ResultSet is positioned before the next row, getXXX will fail
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
calling deleteRow again w/o first positioning the ResultSet on the next row will fail
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
Position the ResultSet with next()
Should be able to deletRow() on the current row now
---Positive Test2 - even if no columns from table specified in the column list, we should be able to get updatable resultset
total number of rows in T1 
	 1
	 -
	{3}
column 1 on this row is 1
total number of rows in T1 after one deleteRow is 
	 1
	 -
	{2}
---Positive Test3 - use prepared statement with concur updatable status
requested TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, CONCUR_UPDATABLE
got TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY? true
got CONCUR_UPDATABLE? true
column 1 on this row is 1
Since after deleteRow(), ResultSet is positioned before the next row, getXXX will fail
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
calling deleteRow again w/o first positioning the ResultSet on the next row will fail
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
Position the ResultSet with next()
Should be able to deletRow() on the current row now
---Positive Test4 - use callable statement with concur updatable status
requested TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, CONCUR_UPDATABLE
got TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY? true
got CONCUR_UPDATABLE? true
row not deleted yet. Confirm with rs.rowDeleted()? false
column 1 on this row is 1
Since after deleteRow(), ResultSet is positioned before the next row, getXXX will fail
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
calling deleteRow again w/o first positioning the ResultSet on the next row will fail
Got expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
Position the ResultSet with next()
Should be able to deletRow() on the current row now
---Positive Test5 - donot have to select primary key to get an updatable resultset
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to delete row when primary key is not selected for that row
---Positive Test6 - For Forward Only resultsets, DatabaseMetaData will return false for ownDeletesAreVisible and deletesAreDetected
---This is because, after deleteRow, we position the ResultSet before the next row. We don't make a hole for the deleted row and then stay on that deleted hole
ownDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
othersDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? true
deletesAreDetected(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
The JDBC program should look at rowDeleted only if deletesAreDetected returns true
Since Derby returns false for detlesAreDetected for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultset,the program should not rely on rs.rowDeleted() for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultsets
Have this call to rs.rowDeleted() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Have this call to rs.rowDeleted() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
---Positive Test7 - delete using updatable resultset api from a temporary table
following rows in temp table before deleteRow
	 C21,C22
	 --- ---
	{21,1}
	{22,1}
As expected, no rows in temp table after deleteRow
	 C21,C22
	 --- ---
---Positive Test8 - change the name of the resultset and see if deleteRow still works
change the cursor name(case sensitive name) with setCursorName and then try to deleteRow
change the cursor name one more time with setCursorName and then try to deleteRow
---Positive Test9 - using correlation name for the table in the select sql is not a problem
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to deleteRow
---Positive Test10 - 2 updatable resultsets going against the same table, will they conflict?
delete using first resultset
attempt to send deleteRow on the same row through a different resultset should throw an exception
Got expected exception Cursor 'SQLCUR10' is not on a row.
Move to next row in the 2nd resultset and then delete using the second resultset
---Positive Test11 - setting the fetch size to > 1 will be ignored by updatable resultset. Same as updatable cursors
Notice the Fetch Size in run time statistics output.
1

---Positive Test12 - make sure delete trigger gets fired when deleteRow is issued
Verify that before delete trigger got fired, row count is 0 in deleteTriggerInsertIntoThisTable
	 1
	 -
	{0}
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to delete row and make sure that trigger got fired

	{1}
---Positive Test13 - With autocommit off, attempt to drop a table when there is an open updatable resultset on it
Opened an updatable resultset. Now trying to drop that table through another Statement
expected exception Operation 'DROP TABLE' cannot be performed on object 'T1' because there is an open ResultSet dependent on that object.
Since autocommit is off, the drop table exception will NOT result in a runtime rollback and hence updatable resultset object is still open
---Positive Test14 - After deleteRow, resultset is positioned before the next row
getXXX right after deleteRow will fail because resultset is not positioned on a row, instead it is right before the next row
expected exception Invalid cursor state - no current row.
Finished testing updateable resultsets
