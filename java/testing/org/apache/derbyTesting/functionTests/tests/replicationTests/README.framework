The current replication tests are run against the Proof of Concept (PoC) code for 
replication.

The intention is that when the replication code is enabled on trunk, the 
replication test framework and tests are in place.


The test framework for replication testing is so far only available for running
on Unix'es, specifically Linux and Solaris. 
Cygwin on Windows should also work but this has not yet been tried.

The test frame work relies on Secure Shell (ssh) to start servers on the master and slave hosts,
and to run test clients and load clients on a set of client and load hosts.

The PoC code has special variants of the Derby code for the master and slave servers.
This must be specified in the '${user.dir}/replicationtest.properties' file
which will contain property definitions similar to what is shown below:

#######################
# Derby version to be used for client and as default for master and slave:
#-----------------------------
derby.version=/home/os136789/Apache/myDerbySandbox/trunk/jars/insane

# Optional specific Derby to be used for master. REQUIRED for PoC code!
derby.masterversion=/home/os136789/Replication/trunk_master/jars/insane

# Optional specific Derby to be used for slave. REQUIRED for PoC code!
derby.slaveversion=/home/os136789/Replication/trunk_slave/jars/insane
#-----------------------------
