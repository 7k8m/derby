<overview>

<p>
Derby is a pure Java relational database engine using standard SQL and
JDBC as its APIs.
</p>

<p>
Derby functionality includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded engine with JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Network Server</li>
<li>Network client JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Command line tools: ij (SQL scripting), dblook (schema dump) and sysinfo (system info)</li>
</ul>

</overview>

<newFeatures>

<p>
This is a feature release. The following new features were added:
</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL ROW_NUMBER() window function, as described in the SQL 2003
standard section 6.10, for an empty, inlined window specification. The
<em>window clause</em>, as described in section 7.11 is not
implemented.</li>

<li>Unique constraints on nullable columns. SQL Feature T591.</li>
	
<li>Asynchronous replication with manual fail-over.</li>

<li>Table Functions. SQL Feature T326. This lets you run queries against
any external data source which can be presented as a JDBC ResultSet. Table Functions are useful
for data migration and integration. For more information, please consult
the "Programming Derby-style table functions" section of the Derby Developer's Guide
as well as the functional specification attached to DERBY-716.</li>

<li>Java Management Extensions (JMX) for Derby, allowing local and remote
monitoring and management of a running Derby system (this release
includes a basic set of MBeans - it is expected that more JMX
functionality will be added in later releases).</li>
	
<li>SQL bracketed comments (/*..*/). SQL Feature T351.</li>

<li>ij continuation marker. Interactive ij shows > prompt until ; is entered.</li>
	
<li>A JDBC statement object cache in the client driver. Some limitations imposed by the presence of DERBY-3596.</li>

<li>Caching of the isolation level and the current schema in the client driver.</li>

<li>Implement a new multi-threaded buffer manager to get better scalability on machines with multiple CPUs or multiple cores.</li>
</ul>
</newFeatures>
