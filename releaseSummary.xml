<overview>

<p>
Derby is a pure Java relational database engine using standard SQL and
JDBC as its APIs.
</p>

<p>
Derby functionality includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded engine with JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Network Server</li>
<li>Network client JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Command line tools: ij (SQL scripting), dblook (schema dump) and sysinfo (system info)</li>
</ul>


<p>
  <b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b><br/>
<br/>
  If you are currently using Derby 10.3.1.4 or Derby 10.3.2.1, it is strongly<br/>
  recommended that you upgrade to Derby 10.4.1.3 or 10.3.3.0 to avoid<br/>
  any chance of database corruption due to an issue with multiple threads<br/>
  accessing a database that is documented in <a
href="issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3347">DERBY-3347</a>.<br/>
<br/>
  This bug can cause unrecoverable database corruption during periods of<br/>
  heavy, multi-thread I/O operations.  The error produced in the test case<br/>
  used to diagnose the problem was:<br/>
<br/>
  ERROR XSDB3: Container information cannot change once written: was 0, now 80.<br/>
<br/>
  It is felt that other errors might also be generated when this type of<br/>
  corruption occurs.  The corruption message will most likely refer to page 0<br/>
  of the container. For example:<br/>
<br/>
  ERROR XSDG1: Page Page(0 ,Container(0, 5856)) could not be<br/>
  written...<br/>
<br/>
  This bug corrupts the pages on disk and can go unnoticed.  If you do not<br/>
  run database consistency checks regularly it is recommended you begin doing<br/>
  so as soon as possible after the upgrade.  To insure that corruption has not<br/>
  already occurred in existing databases, after upgrade run the database<br/>
  consistency check at least once to validate all tables in the database.  This<br/>
  process is documented at:<br/>
<br/>
  <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/DatabaseConsistencyCheck">http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/DatabaseConsistencyCheck</a><br/>
<br/>
If the corruption has already occurred there is no guaranteed recovery of data<br/>
other than to recover from the last good backup.  When doing so one should<br/>
also check that the previous backup did not also have the corruption.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases one may recover data from the existing<br/>
database, depending on the extent of the corruption, but will require<br/>
by hand data recovery.  Depending on the type of corruption this may<br/>
be successful or not. one should consult the Derby list if attempting<br/>
this recovery - no automatic software solution to this recovery exists.<br/>
